it uses "ps", "pgrep" and reads /proc filesystem.

    Linux, Python 2.5.2 and 2.7.2
    FreeBSD 8.1, Python 2.6.5 (with mounted procfs)
    OpenSolaris, Python 2.4.4


Modifications included in Screen bundled with screen-session:

    - New commands:
        - dumpscreen [window|layout|history] filename [-F]
        - tty
        - maxlay
    - make "group", "maxwin"  queryable
    - associate focuminsize with the layout
    - fix monitor crash


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation - part 1 - installing screen-session
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (screen-session is installed
into the /usr/local/ namespace by default), you can also disable colors
by removing "-DCOLOR".

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install
screen-session:

    make clean
    make

    make install        # if necessary as root 
                        # it also symlinks screen-session as "scs"

Note that the installation step is optional, only compilation is necessary.
Just link to from your PATH to:
screen-session-VERSION/ScreenSession/screen-session


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation - part 2 - installing modified GNU Screen
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile and install the modified Screen:

    cd screen-session-VERSION/screen-4.1.0

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make

    sudo make install
