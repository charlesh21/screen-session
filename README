Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
screen-session is a collection of tools for GNU Screen, including
session saver.

session saver currently supports saving of:
layouts, scrollbacks, titles, filters and is able to restart programs 
run in windows. It recognizes groups and regular windows. Currently there 
is no support for serial and telnet window types.

Available screen-session modes:

----
save        - save Screen session to file

load        - load session from file

ls          - list saved sessions
----

manager     - sessions manager (screenie like) but featuring session 
              preview in a split window

nest        - nest layout in the current region

regions     - display number in every region
              (like tmux display-panes)

dir         - starts a new Screen window in the same working directory 
              on the position next to the current window

dump        - dump informations about windows in session

grab        - change tty of a process to this terminal

group       - move windows to a group

kill        - send signal to last process started in a window

kill-zombie - kill all zombie windows in session

kill-cgroup - recursively kill all windows in the current group

renumber    - renumber windows to fill gaps

sort        - sort windows by title

Detailed Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
session saver saves directories and programs by directly reading /proc 
filesystem and sorts them by parent pid.  There is almost no "stuffing" 
so there is no interaction with programs in windows.

After session loading, in every new window starts screen-session-primer 
(small C program) which displays a list of processes and asks user what 
to do (whether to start none, part of or all window's processes).
Then, primer tries to restore the string of processes by execing 
for nodes:
$ shell -c "program args; shell" 
and for leafs:
$ program args 

Entire string of processes can only be properly restored if every 
non-leaf is a shell which accepts '-c command' switch.

Can be restored completly:
0 zsh -> 1 bash -> 2 vim hello.c 

Only up to 1:
0 zsh -> 1 man hello -> 2 less


There is also a blacklist for programs which may not be started
(file $HOME/.screen-sessions/BLACKLIST).
 
screen-session-primer uses linux color escapes. If you dont want color
remove "-DCOLOR" from config.mk

Normally screen-session does not restore exact window numbers. If you 
want to force verbatim restoring use --exact flag.

Savefiles are .tar.bz2 archives (scrollbacks can take a *lot* of space). 
Temporary files are stored in  /tmp/screen-session-$USER.

By default session saver also tries to save vim sessions using ":mksession"
and ":wviminfo".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no bugs, only features.

- Do not try to save/load a completly detached session with enabled 
  layouts in screen-session because Screen will crash.
  Disable layouts saving/loading with --no-layout flag.

- If screen-session locks your session try to find and kill all processes
  started by it. If session saver caused the lock it is usually enough to
  run: $ pkill -f "@lastmsg"
