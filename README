============================

Description
-----------
screen-session is a GNU Screen session saver.

screen-session currently supports saving of:
groups and basic windows, directories, programs, layouts, scrollbacks, titles

It recognizes groups and regular windows. Currently there is no support for 
serial and telnet window types (because so far I didn't manage to use them) 
but they would be probably easy to add. 

screen-session saves directories and programs by directly reading /proc 
filesystem  ( it reads cwd, exe and cmdline ) and sorts them by parent pid. 
There is no "stuffing" and there is totally no interaction with programs in
windows.

After session loading, in every new window starts screen-session-primer 
(small C program) which displays list of processes and asks user what to do
(whether to start none, part of or all window's processes).                                                                       

There is also a blacklist for programs which may not be started
(file $HOME./screen-sessions/BLACKLIST).
 
screen-session-primer uses linux color escapes. If you dont want color
remove "-DCOLOR" from config.mk



Requirements
------------
screen-session REQUIRES a recent version of Screen patched with screen-session.diff.
screen-session.py depends on "lsof", "grep" and reads /proc filesystem.


screen-session.diff changes:
- add "tty" command
- make "layout" and "group" and "maxwin" and "sessionname" queryable



Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (screen-session is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default), you can also disable colors by removing
"-DCOLOR".


Afterwards enter the following command to build and install screen-session
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Make sure you have a recent version of Screen and apply necessary patch:

    git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/screen.git screen; cd screen
    
    git-apply ../screen-session-${VERSION}/screen-session.diff

    cd src; autoreconf; autoheader; ./configure && make

    sudo make install

Saving:
    # save inside saved session 
    screen-session --save --force

    screen-session --save --maxwin {biggest window number}
    
    # save inside saved session without layouts
    screen-session --save --layout 

    # save saving session with PID in mysavedsession folder
    screen-session --save --in PID --out mysavedsession


Loading:
    # load last saved session inside target session
    screen-session --load
    
    # load last saved session inside target session without layouts
    screen-session --load --layout

    # load session saved in folder mysavedsession loaded to Screen with PID
    screen-session --load --in mysavedsession --out PID
