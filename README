Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
screen-session is a collection of tools for GNU Screen. 
It includes a session saver and a session manager, among others.

session saver currently supports saving of:
layouts, scrollbacks, titles, filters and is able to restart programs 
run in windows. It recognizes groups and regular windows. Currently there 
is no support for serial and telnet window types.
Session saver also saves VIM sessions inside Screen session.

Available screen-session modes:

----
save        - save Screen ( and VIM ) session
load        - load session
ls          - list saved sessions
----

dir         - starts a new Screen window in the same working directory 
              on the position next to the current window
manager     - sessions manager (screenie like) but featuring session 
              preview in a split window
name        - get or set sessionname
nest        - nest layout in the current region
regions     - display number in every region (like tmux display-panes)
dump        - dump informations about windows in session
find-pid    - find PIDs in windows
find-file   - find open files in windows (requires lsof)
group       - move windows to a group
kill        - send signal to last process started in a window
kill-zombie - kill all zombie windows in session
kill-group  - recursively kill all windows in a group
renumber    - renumber windows to fill gaps

Detailed Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
session saver saves directories and programs by directly reading /proc 
filesystem and sorts them by parent pid.  There is almost no "stuffing" 
(except when saving vim sessions) so there is no interaction with 
programs in windows.

After session loading, in every new window starts screen-session-primer 
(small C program) which displays a list of processes and asks user what 
to do (whether to start none, part of or all window's processes).
Then, primer tries to restore the string of processes by execing 
for nodes:
$ shell -c "program args; shell" 
and for leafs:
$ program args 

Entire string of processes can only be properly restored if every 
non-leaf is a shell which accepts '-c command' switch.

Can be restored completly:
0 zsh -> 1 bash -> 2 vim hello.c 

Only up to 1:
0 zsh -> 1 man hello -> 2 less


There is also a blacklist for programs which may not be started
(file $HOME/.screen-sessions/BLACKLIST).
 
screen-session-primer uses linux color escapes. If you dont want color
remove "-DCOLOR" from config.mk

Normally screen-session does not restore exact window numbers. If you 
want to force verbatim restoring use --exact flag.

Savefiles are .tar.bz2 archives (scrollbacks can take a *lot* of space). 
Temporary files are stored in  /tmp/screen-session-$USER.

By default session saver also tries to save vim sessions using ":mksession"
and ":wviminfo".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Many of the tools do not work with detached Screen sessions.
- slow startup if hardstatus is not ":hardstatus lastline"
- :msgminwait is set to 0 the original value is not restored.
