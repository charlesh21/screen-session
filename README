Detailed Description of session saver
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Session saver currently supports saving of:
layouts, scrollbacks, titles, filters and is able to restart programs
run in windows. It recognizes regular, group and zombie windows. 
Currently there is no support for serial and telnet window types.
Session saver also saves VIM sessions inside the Screen session.

session saver saves directories and programs by directly reading /proc 
filesystem and sorts them by parent pid. There is almost no "stuffing" 
(except when saving vim sessions) so there is no interaction with 
programs in windows.

After session loading, in every new window starts screen-session-primer
(a small C program) which displays a list of processes and asks user what
to do (whether to start none, part of or all window's processes).
Then, primer tries to restore the string of processes by execing
for nodes:
$ shell -c "program args; shell"
and for leafs:
$ program args

Entire string of processes can only be properly restored if every
non-leaf is a shell which accepts '-c command' switch.

Can be restored completly:
0 zsh -> 1 bash -> 2 vim hello.c

Only up to 1:
0 zsh -> 1 man hello -> 2 less

screen-session-primer uses linux color escapes. If you dont want color
remove "-DCOLOR" from config.mk

Normally screen-session does not restore exact window numbers. If you
want to force verbatim restoring use --exact flag.

Savefiles are .tar.bz2 archives (scrollbacks can take a *lot* of space).
Temporary files are stored in  /tmp/screen-session-$USER.

By default session saver also tries to save vim sessions using ":mksession"
and ":wviminfo".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some tools do not work with detached Screen sessions.
- slow startup if hardstatus is not ":hardstatus lastline"
- in order to speed up Screen commands execution :msgminwait is set to 0
  and the original value is not restored.
