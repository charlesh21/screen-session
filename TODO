* Create shellrc plug for more accurate command line saving 
  and an ability to save other users processes
* Write a .vimrc snippet for automatic undo history saving in vim 7.3+
* Save parameters which can be passed to :screen
    flow-control options (-f, -fn and -fa), monitoring (-M), logging (-L) 
    login options (-l and -ln) , terminal type  option  (-T  <term>),  
    the  all-capability-flag  (-a)
* Detect and filter "orphaned" processes (eg started with &)

  rename them easily
